<p>Clash Royale is a free real-time tower strategy game that has been credited for restructuring the mobile gaming market. 
Mimicking its ancient conf√®re, Clash Royale employs many similar characters operated in Clash of Clans, while settling them in 
a dissimilar playing field. The game has innumerable cards which can be deployed in a match to compete with possible adversary's. 
Each card represents a character, and there are multitudinous tiers of cards fluctuating from common to legendary. The readily 
available characters span from ranged shooters to tanks. The success of Clash Royale allowed for the creation ofan entirely new 
genre of tower strategy card game in the mobile industry. After its release on March 2, 2016, the game succeeded expectations, 
earning over a billion dollars in revenue by the end of its first year.</p>
